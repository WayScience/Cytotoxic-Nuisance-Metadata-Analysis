# # Feature Processing and Selection
#
# This notebook focuses on exploration using two essential files: the annotations data extracted from the actual screening profile (available in the [IDR repository](https://github.com/IDR/idr0133-dahlin-cellpainting/tree/main/screenA)) and the metadata retrieved from the supplementary section of the [research paper](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-023-36829-x/MediaObjects/41467_2023_36829_MOESM5_ESM.xlsx).
#
# We explore the number of unique compounds associated with each cell injury and subsequently cross-reference this information with the screening profile. The aim is to assess the feasibility of using the data for training a machine learning model to predict cell injury.
#
# We apply feature selection through [pycytominer](https://github.com/cytomining/pycytominer) to capture the most informative features representing various cellular injury types within the morphology space. Then, we utilize the selected feature profiles for machine learning applications.

# Next, the `injured_df` is generated, which will exclusively contain wells treated with a component that induces an injury. This was accomplished by utilizing supplemental data that detailed which treatments caused specific injuries. We then cross-referenced this data with the image-based profile to identify wells treated with those components and labeled them with the associated injury.

# ## Feature Selection on the Cell-Injury Data
#
# Here, we will perform a feature selection using Pycytominer on the labeled cell-injury dataset to identify morphological features that are indicative of cellular damage. By selecting these key features, we aim to enhance our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying cellular injuries. The selected features will be utilized to train a multi-class logistic regression model, allowing us to determine which morphological characteristics are most significant in discerning various types of cellular injuries.## Feature selecting on the cell-injury data.

# - feature selected cell injury profiles
# - the feature space associated with this profile.

# ## Identifying Shared Features between JUMP and Cell Injury Datasets
#
# In this section, we identify the shared features present in both the normalized cell-injury and the JUMP pilot dataset. Next, we utilize these shared features to update our dataset and use it for feature selection in the next step.
