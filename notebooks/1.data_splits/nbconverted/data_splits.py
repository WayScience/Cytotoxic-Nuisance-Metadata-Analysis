# ## Data Splitting

# ### Holdout Dataset
#
# Here we collected out holdout dataset. The holdout dataset is a subset of the dataset that is not used during model training or tuning. Instead, it is reserved solely for evaluating the model's performance after it has been trained.
#
# In this notebook, we will include three different types of held-out datasets before proceeding with our machine learning training and evaluation.
#  - Plate hold out
#  - treatment hold out
#  - well hold out
#
# Each of these held outdata will be stored in the `results/0.data_splits` directory
#

# ### Holdout out a treatment holdout plate
#
# Here we are randomly select 15 wells from each treatment from the main dataframe `labeled_df`. Then we remove those wells from the main dataframe

# In[10]:

# ### Generating well holdout data
#
# To generate the well hold out data, each plate was iterated and random wells were selected. However, an additional step was condcuting which was to seperate the control wells and the treated wells, due to the large label imbalance with the controls. Therefore, 5 wells were randomly selected and 10 wells were randomly selected from each individual plate
